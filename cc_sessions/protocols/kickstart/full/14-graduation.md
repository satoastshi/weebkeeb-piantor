# Graduation

You made it! Let's recap what you've accomplished and wrap up.

## What You Learned

**Core Workflow:**
- DAIC enforcement keeps me from randomly editing code without approval
- Task management with git branch enforcement prevents mistakes
- Four main protocols: task creation, startup, completion, compaction
- Trigger phrases for entering implementation mode and other workflows

**Configuration:**
- Customized trigger phrases for your natural language
- Repository detection found your tech stack and git settings
- Git preferences set (commit style, auto-merge, auto-push, submodules)
- Tool configuration (blocked tools, custom readonly commands)

**Agents:**
- context-gathering agent customized for your project patterns
- code-review agent customized for your security and performance needs
- Other agents left at defaults (can customize later if needed)

**Advanced Features:**
- Bypass mode for emergency escape hatch
- Directory tasks for complex multi-phase work
- Task indexes for organizing lots of tasks
- Stashed todos that survive compaction
- `/sessions` slash command interface with smart help

## Your Configuration

Let me show you what you've configured:

{users_config}

**What this means for your experience:**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- Say "[their implementation phrases]" to approve implementation
- Say "[their discussion phrases]" to emergency stop
- Say "[their creation phrase]" to create tasks
- Say "[their completion phrase]" to complete tasks
- Say "[their compaction phrase]" to compact context

**Git Workflow:**
- Commit style: [their style] - [explain what that means]
- Auto-merge: [their setting] - [when tasks complete, explain behavior]
- Auto-push: [their setting] - [explain push behavior]
- Submodules (if they have them): [their setting] - [explain protocol adaptations]

**Tool Blocking:**
- Discussion mode blocks: [their blocked tools]
- Custom readonly: [their readonly commands]
- Custom write-like: their write-like commands
- Extrasafe: whether they want to block commands not in read or write by default

**Features:**
- Auto-ultrathink: their settings

**After they respond:**

If they want changes, help them make adjustments by recommending the right `/sessions config` commands (to get them used to tweaking their own config as needed).

When they're ready:

## Wrapping Up

Let me finalize your kickstart completion.

Run: `python -m sessions.kickstart complete`

[Wait for command to run]

---

**After kickstart complete runs:**

Perfect! You're all set up.

Now, let's clear this context window and start fresh with your first task.

**Next steps:**
1. Run `/clear` to start a fresh session
2. After clearing, say "lets continue"
3. I'll load your first task: [their task name]
4. Use your startup trigger phrase: `[their startup phrase] @[their task name]`
5. We'll get to work!

Ready when you are. Run `/clear` and let's go build something.
