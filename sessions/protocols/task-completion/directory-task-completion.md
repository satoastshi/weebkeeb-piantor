## Directory Task Completion Check

**IMPORTANT: This is a directory task with multiple subtasks**

Before completing this directory task:

1. **Verify ALL subtasks are complete**
   - Check the README.md subtask tracking section
   - Ensure each subtask file shows completed status
   - Confirm no pending work remains in any subtask

2. **Review overall success criteria**
   - Return to the main README.md file
   - Verify that ALL success criteria for the entire task are satisfied
   - The sum of subtask completions should fulfill the main task goals

3. **Commit but DO NOT merge yet**
   - Individual subtask work should be committed to the task branch
   - Do NOT merge to {default_branch} until the entire directory task is complete
   - Only when ALL subtasks are done should the branch merge to main

[STATUS: Directory Task Completion]
If this is genuinely the final subtask:
✓ All subtasks marked complete in README.md
✓ All success criteria satisfied
✓ Ready for final merge to {default_branch}

If subtasks remain:
✗ Some subtasks still pending
✗ Continue working on remaining subtasks
✗ Commit changes but do not merge
