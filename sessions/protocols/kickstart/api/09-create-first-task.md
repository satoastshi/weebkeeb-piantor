# Create Your First Task

Let's create a real task to work on.

## Pick Something Real But Small

Think of something you know needs to be done:
- A bug to fix
- A small feature to add
- Something to refactor
- Code to review

Start small - pick something you can describe in a sentence or two.

What task comes to mind?

[Wait for response]

**After they describe their task:**

Perfect! Use your task creation trigger phrase with that description.

Example: `[their phrase]: fix the login redirect loop`

[Wait for them to trigger task creation]

**When they trigger task creation:**

Follow the task creation protocol completely:

1. Propose task naming (priority, type, descriptive name)
2. Ask about success criteria
3. Offer context-gathering agent (recommend yes to see it in action)
4. Ask about task indexes (if applicable)
5. Commit the task file

---

**After task creation protocol completes:**

Run: `python -m sessions.kickstart next`
